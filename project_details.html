        <div class="research-explanation">
            <h2>Explanation</h2>
            <p>
                Due to intense population growth and urbanization in Istanbul, 
                more public transportation vehicles are needed. Expanding the number 
                of vehicles to meet this increases carbon emissions and affects air 
                pollution. The carbon emissions of vehicles will be analyzed by year 
                and the change will be estimated for the following years. Since electric 
                vehicles do not emit carbon emissions, we predict that their integration into 
                public transportation may have a reducing effect on carbon emissions in transportation. 
                However, carbon is released during the production of electricity used for charging the vehicle. 
                Considering these factors, first the number of vehicles in traffic will be predicted, and then the carbon 
                emissions of normal vehicles and electric vehicles will be compared.
